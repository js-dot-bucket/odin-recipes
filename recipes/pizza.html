        <h2> Description </h2>
        <p>
            Pizza is a versatile and delicious dish that typically features a crisp, chewy crust topped with tomato sauce, melted cheese, and a variety of toppings. Making pizza at home allows you to customize the flavors and ingredients to your liking, whether you prefer classic Margherita, veggie-loaded, or meat-topped varieties. The basic components include dough, sauce, cheese, and toppings, all baked to perfection for a satisfying meal.
